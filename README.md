Dead-simple tool to cast files to chromecast devices forked from [craig-chasseur/simplecast](https://github.com/craig-chasseur/simplecast), this will be more focused on control through either a simple terminal interface and then a graphical interface.  It's for if you want to cast & control your media straight from your computer in one simple stroke.

so far there is the terminal module, server module and cast module, argparser has been removed as media will be searched, selected and controlled in an event based way.

anyone expert with curses (or some other TUI library) who thinks they can make a brief and simpler terminal module please feel free to push, furthermore if you are expert in wxpython (wixwidgets) I would appreciate that for the GUI I will probably use tkinter in the mean while, as I know that best
